# sparqlalchemy

A simple (buy hopefully reasonably efficient) implementation of an RDF triple store on top of SQLAlchemy. 

Fundamental Idea here is to translate SPARQL queries into SQLAlchemy's SQL Expression Language in order to
run them on (hopefully) any SQL database SQLAlchemy supports with reasonable efficiency.

Triples are hosted in a single, flat table.

Currently, re-uses much of RDFLib's infrastructure for parsing tasks.

*Note*: This is work in progress. While I do aim for RDF/SPARQL standards compliance where possible, there
is no (and most probably never will be) any guarantee that this triple store is complete and/or compliant
with regards to any semantic web standards. Efficiency and portability are my main goals here.

Requirements
============

*Note*: very incomplete.

* Python 2.7 
* RDFLib
* SQLAlchemy
* py-nltools
